		Poly enables developers to build true native applications, such as AppKit, Gtk, and WinUI.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Language Agnostic" icon="translate">
		Poly is language-agnostic, so any programming language can be used to develop Poly applications,
		as long as an implementation is available.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Write Once, Run Anywhere" icon="rocket">
		Write application logic once, and the application will run on all supported platforms.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Work in Progress!" icon="open-book">
		Poly is still a work-in-progress. Any feedback is appreciated!
